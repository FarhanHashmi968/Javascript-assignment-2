// 1. You are provided with two numbers a and b. Your task is to add these two numbers.
// let a= 2;
// let b=5;
// let c= a+b;
// console.log(c)




// 2. You are given two number first as a and second as b and check if both conditions
// (a<10 and a>b) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.
// let a=5;
// let b=3;
// console.log(a<10 && a>b)





// 3 You are given two numbers a and b. You need to do the following checks:
// 1. if both are divisible by 10 console true.
// 2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
// 3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true
// let a = 10;
// let b = 23;
// console.log((a % 10) == 0 || (b % 10) == 0)



// 4 Find the first digit of a 4 digit number
// let a = 7625;
// console.log(Math.floor(a / 1000))



// 5. You are provided a four digit number a only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that
// number.
// let a = 4567;
// console.log(a % 10)





// 6 You are provided with two numbers a and b where a as divisor and b as dividend.Your task is find the remainder.
// let a = 2;
// let b = 9;
// console.log(b % a)




// 7 You are provided with two numbers a and b. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.
// let a = 2;
// let b = 5;
// console.log(a * b)




// 8 Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as a, b, and c(out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average.
// let a = 50;
// let b = 20;
// let c = 100;
// let sum = a + b + c;
// let average = (a + b + c) / 3;
// console.log(sum, average)
